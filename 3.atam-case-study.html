## Lightweight ATAM

- Smaller and less risky projects
- Smaller internal team
</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
### Steps
1. ~~Present ATAM~~ (x)
2. Present business driver/context for system development (15 min)
3. Present architecture (25 min)
4. Identify architecture approaches
</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
5. Generate UtilityTree (Utility Tree + scenarios exist, review in 1h)
  - a) Hierarchize attributes and quantify meaning
  - b) (6) ~~analyze architectural approaches~~ (x)
  - (7) Define and prioritize scenarios
8. Compare scenarios and architecture (2-3h)
  - Identify risks, sensitivity points and compromises (in step 5)
9. Document results (0.5 h)

## Business drivers

adventure builder
- consistent user experience
- easy integration with new business partners 
</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
### Feature list
1. The user can visit the Adventure Builder Web site and browse the catalog of travel packages, which include
- flights to specific destinations,
- lodging options, 
- activities that can be purchased in advance. Activities include mountain biking, fishing, surfing classes, hot air balloon tours, and scuba diving. 
The user can select transportation, accommodation, and various activities to build his/her own adventure trip.
</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
2. The user can place an order for a vacation package. To process this order, the system has to interact with several external entities. 
- A bank will approve the customer payment, 
- airline companies will provide the flights, 
- lodging providers will book the hotel rooms,
- businesses that provide vacation activities will schedule the activities selected by the customer.
</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
3. After an order is placed, the user can return to check the status of his/her order. This is necessary because some interactions 
with external entities are processed in the background and may take hours or days to complete.
</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
4. The internal system periodically interacts with its business partners (transportation, lodging, and activity providers) to update the catalog with the most recent offerings.

### Architectural Approaches
- overarching architectural approach: Hub-and-spoke 
- SOAP: The OPC uses SOAP-based Web services to communicate with the Consumer Web site and external business partners. 
- WSDL
- ESB product is not used
- OPC has a centralized workflow manager that contains all process rules and flow logic to coordinate the processing of customer orders
- Consumer Web site is the Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern
</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">

### Scenarios
#### Modifiability
- QAS1. A new business partner (airline, lodging, or activity provider) that uses its own web services interface is added to the system in no more than 10 person-days of effort for the implementation. The business goal is easy integration with new business partners.
</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
#### Performance
- QAS2. When a user places an order for an adventure travel package to the Consumer Web site, the user should be notified on screen that the order has been successfully submitted and is being processed in less than five seconds.
</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
- QAS3. Up to 500 users click to see the catalog of adventure packages following a random distribution over 1 minute; the system is under normal operating conditions; the maximal latency to serve the first page of content is under 5 seconds; average latency for same is less than 2 seconds.
</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
#### Reliability
- QAS4. The Consumer Web site sent a purchase order request to the order processing center (OPC). The OPC processed that request but didn't reply to Consumer Web site within five seconds, so the Consumer Web site resends the request to the OPC. The OPC receives the duplicate request, but the consumer is not double-charged, data remains in a consistent state, and the Consumer Web site is notified that the original request was successful in one hundred percent of the times.
</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
#### Security
- QAS5. Credit approval and payment processing are requested for a new order. In one hundred percent of the cases, the transaction is completed securely and cannot be repudiated by either party. The business goals are to provide customers and business partners confidence in security and to meet contractual, legal, and regulatory obligations for secure credit transactions.
</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
- QAS6. The OPC experiences a flood of calls through the Web Service Broker endpoint that do not correspond to any current orders. In one hundred percent of the times, the system detects the abnormal level of activity, notifies the system administrator, and continues to service requests in a degraded mode.
</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
#### Availability
- QAS7. The Consumer Web site is available to the user 24x7. If an instance of OPC application fails, the fault is detected and the system administrator is notified in 30 seconds; the system continues taking order requests; another OPC instance is created; and data remains in a consistent state.
